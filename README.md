# BasicFullStack
Basic Full Stack App I made using MySQL, Python-Flask, and ReactJS


You will need MySQL, Python, and NodeJS.

First create a MySQL table with an id column, a user column, a date column, a payment1 column, and payment2 column.

Next start the python script to host apis that contain the sql data. The data will be represented as a JSON that you can use for whatever purpose you want. Make sure to change the login details to suit your database.

There is other data hosted besides the data for the graph. You can view these with curl or in your browser.

Finally open a node.js command prompt and run npm start in the frontend folder.

Make sure to unzip the src folder.

You should have a login screen with the username and password that you can change in the pyhton file.

Once you login, there should be a basic graph displayed that you can zoom into and change what series you want to see.
